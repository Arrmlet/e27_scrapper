MarketFriends was conceptually built on the premise that information, and communication of that information, are primary drivers of profitable trading in the financial markets. Furthermore, we believe that a superior information and communication network has traditionally provided a distinct competitive advantage for Wall Street traders, as compared to independent traders on 'Main Street.'

MarketFriends seeks to narrow that information and communication gap. As the retail trading community grows larger, it becomes a much greater force in the financial markets. Knowing what the retail trading community is doing is becoming an increasingly important priority for all traders. They are that community! Their network of independent traders across the globe provides the framework for better informed, and thus, more profitable trading.

The vast reach of the MarketFriends community increases the depth and breadth of information available to independent traders. From doctors to carpenters to housewives, they are a diverse network of people from all walks of life. A tidbit of information communicated from a factory worker in an autoplant in South Korea, for example, might provide invaluable insight into the Korean automotive industry that a lawyer in New York City might have never otherwise discovered on his or her own.

Registration is free and artists can create their own portals so event hosts and venues such as restaurants and bars can find and book them for gigs.

A large majority of artists such as musicians, singers, hosts and entertainers find it difficult to find gigs due to limited resources, lack of industry connections and poor management. As a result they don’t reach their full earning potential and their quality of life does not improve. Some artists even undercut themselves just to get much needed gigs.

GigSplash bridges the gap between artists and venues through an online portal where artists can showcase their talents to potential employers in the Philippines and abroad. The site makes it easy for both parties to negotiate a fair price for the artists’ services. Payments are secured so artists can focus on good performance.

This is a first in the country and based on informal surveys local artists love the idea and hope to become early adopters of the technology. Touted as the UBER of gigs, it relies on the popularity of on-demand service emerging in different verticals. The platform will not replace the traditional manager-artist relationships but will supplement it.

They want to help the Pinoy Music community by providing the easiest and fastest way to book gigs for them through their site -- the first online booking portal in the Philippines. They provide a platform that could help them market their talents and skills."

Listeners can’t remember what they hear on radio particularly when driving. And broadcasters and advertisers don’t know who’s listening to radio.

They've Uncovered A Massive Unmet Need
They have validated what intuitively seems true, that drivers care enough about what they are listening to on radio to want to remember and interact with the content. Their two live prototype tests have shown that across AM/FM and digital radio, drivers used AirShr once per day and began to listen more actively to the radio in their cars. At its core this need is to support recall for people increasingly overwhelmed with information, media and tasks.

Significant Opportunity
90M people listen to radio in their car each week in the USA, UK & Australia.

Radio Broadcasters Are AirShr's Customers
With AirShr, radio broadcasters are now able to put a higher value on advertising inventory. For the first time they can show advertisers not only who was listening, but who was interested and who took advantage of a call-to-action. The value this can bring to advertisers is significant as they face a media landscape shifting to digital and struggle for mindshare as content sources proliferate.

AirShr helps broadcasters enhance the value of radio to marketers, by adding the benefits of digital marketing to the best qualities of broadcast radio. We have also proved that AirShr increases the value of radio to Listeners, by enriching their listening experience and letting them interact with radio. At any time, a listener can tune into any of their favourite stations and 'AirShr' any content that piqued their interest - talk, music, commercials or news and interact directly with the radio station by voting in a real-time poll.

AirShr's mission is to make life insanely simple to remember and it starts with radio."
